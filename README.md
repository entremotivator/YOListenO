# <div align="center">Machine Learning Project Life Cycle</div>

## Summary

This transcript discusses the major steps of a machine learning project life cycle, including scoping, data collection, model training, deployment, and maintenance.

## Main Points

- The machine learning project life cycle is an effective way to plan out all the steps needed to build a machine learning system and minimize surprises.
- The major steps of a machine learning project include scoping, data collection, model training, deployment, and maintenance.
- During the scoping phase, you define the project and decide what to work on.
- During the data collection phase, you acquire the data you need for your algorithm, define the data, establish a baseline, and label and organize the data.
- During the model training phase, you select and train the model, perform error analysis, and update the model as needed.
- During the deployment phase, you deploy the system in production, monitor the system, track the data, and maintain the system.
- Maintenance may involve going back to perform more error analysis, retrain the model, or update the data.

## Action Items

- Define the project during the scoping phase.
- Acquire the data needed for the algorithm during the data collection phase.
- Select and train the model, perform error analysis, and update the model as needed during the model training phase.
- Deploy the system in production, monitor the system, track the data, and maintain the system during the deployment phase.
- Go back to perform more error analysis, retrain the model, or update the data during the maintenance phase.

## Follow Up Questions

- What are some best practices for data collection?
- How do you select and train the model?
- What are some common challenges during the deployment phase?
- How do you monitor and maintain the system after deployment?
- How do you update the model and data during the maintenance phase?

## Potential Arguments

- The machine learning project life cycle may not be applicable to all machine learning projects.
- The life cycle may not account for unexpected challenges or changes in the project.
- The life cycle may not address ethical considerations in machine learning.

## Announcements
* Frank Lyons is running late
* Gary Cope and Karl Madden have emailed apologies
* Joey Ballon Wayza is struggling with personal issues

## Agenda

### Agenda 1 â€” Car Parking Issues
* Lucy Strokes highlights problems with staff arguing over spaces
* Suggestion to send an email to staff informing them that there are only five spaces belonging to the company
* Consider priority parking for those who need their cars during work hours, such as the sales team
* Sue and Jason to be allocated the two remaining spaces, with Jason's car taking up two spaces
* Three spaces reserved for clients and visitors

### Agenda 2 â€” Staff Morale
* Concerns about low sales figures and increased sick leave
* Lack of training and effective appraisals
* Hold a separate meeting to discuss the predominant reason for low morale and to work on tackling it
* Hold a team challenge or awards night to boost morale
* Send out a questionnaire to gather feedback from staff

### Agenda 3 â€” Technical and Training Issues
* Technical problem that occurred on Friday caused by an external energy issue
* Pay the electricity bill on time
* Training issue to be discussed in the next two weeks
* Report from Gary shows that they had a tough year but are doing well in contract sales
* Down on revenue and handset sales abroad

## Action Items
* Designate priority parking spaces and revoke parking privileges for those who park inconsiderately
* Hold a separate meeting to discuss the predominant reason for low morale and to work on tackling it
* Send out a questionnaire to gather feedback from staff
* Pay the electricity bill on time
* Discuss training issue in the next two weeks
